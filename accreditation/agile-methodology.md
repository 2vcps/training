# Agile 101

> You can't gather all the requirements up front
 The requirements you do gather **will** change
 There is always more to do than time and money will allow

# How bad is it?

> 18% of software projects are considered "failed", 43% "challenged"

> 39% actually succeeding

-- 2012 study by [The Standish Group](http://www.versionone.com/assets/img/files/CHAOSManifesto2013.pdf)

# What can happen without Agile?

* Software projects aren't delivered on time to market
* Requirements not met with high cost to make changes after delivery
* Having to “get it right” first time/up front is really hard

# Software Development Methodologies
* "Code-fix” (or no process)
* Structured, heavy weight methodologies a.k.a.
“Plan Driven Methodologies” and “Waterfall”

---

# Traditional waterfall process

# Waterfall Methodology

* Largely influenced by _traditional engineering_ and _quality processes_ in industries
* Desire to make software development more _predictable_, _measurable_ and _efficient_
* Strong emphasis on _detailed planning_ and then _executing to the plan_

---

# But Software is Different

* Is not Tangible
* Is not based on Mathematics
* Needs Knowledge Workers

---

# Relevance
###Heavy weight methodologies are most successful when:

 - Requirements are stable
 - Technology is well known and mature
 - Everything happens as one would expect
 - We are not taking on anything new or unknown
 - Coding is ‘copy and paste’

---

# That's not true for most projects though

---

# Origins Of Agile

###Agile Methods are a reaction to:

* Rigidity of heavy weight methods
* Bureaucracy introduced by heavy weight methods
* Unpleasant surprises due to lack of visibility
* **The myth that a well defined process is more valuable than the people who use it**

---

# Agile Follows Systems Thinking
* System Thinking is a way of looking at how things influence each other as a whole and not as individual parts
* Focus on Flow, not Function
* Look at the end-to-end process and the value we deliver to our customers
  * What do our customers value
  * How do we respond to the demands from our customers, as a system

---

# Agile Follows Lean Thinking
* Add nothing but value (eliminate waste)
* Flow value from demand (delay commitment)
* Minimize inventory (minimize intermediate artifacts)
* Optimize across the organization

# The Agile Manifesto

---

>We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

* **Individuals and interactions** over _processes and tools_
* **Working software** over _comprehensive documentation_
* **Customer collaboration** over _contract negotiation_
* **Responding to change** over _following a plan_.

>That is, while there is value in the items on _the right_,
we value the **items on the left** more.

#12 Principles of Agile

* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.
* Deliver working software frequently, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

---

#12 Principles of Agile (cont)

* Business people and developers must work together throughout the project.
* Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information is face-to-face conversation.

---

#12 Principles of Agile (cont)

* Working software is the primary measure of progress.
* Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

---

#12 Principles of Agile (cont)

* Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential.
* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.
