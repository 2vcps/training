## Your customers are using more modern tools than the old standbys of SharePoint and email

# Let's start with email

Multitasking with email may seem like it's productive but it's mostly distracting
Email takes up around 28% of the average desk workerâ€™s day
It's been estimated to take up to an average of 23 minutes to get back to the task at hand
Sometimes you forget to answer an email and it will frustrate the sender
Reply-All...

# Phone calls

Can sometimes be very distracting, both to you and the people around you
1-to-1 communication is great for certain things, but useless for team communication

# Modern tools

Modern tools are allowing for semi-synchronous communication and collaboration
Across regions and timezones
Answering something in a chat is faster than an email
Visualizing tasks are better than having them in an out-of-date spreadsheet

# ChatOps

Team members type commands into a chat room, a chat bot then executes those commands
Commands can range from deployments to security event responses to team notifications
The entire team collaborates in real-time
