# Infrastructure As Code

## Jonas Rosland & Matt Cowger

# Why define infrastructure as code?

 - Deploy, monitor and connect together all the pieces needed to run services for the organization
 - Processes and tools for faster end-to-end delivery of quality services
 - Automation comes built-in

# Why should you care? (1/2)

 - Accelerate push-to-production demands
  - No more waiting up to 6 months for a change
 - Enhance customer satisfaction
  - Real end-user experience monitoring
 - Solve configuration drift issues
  - Dev should look like Test which looks like Production

# Why should you care? (2/2)

 - Detect incidents correctly
  - Know exactly what's wrong, where and why
 - Resolve problems faster
  - With correct deployment procedures, changes can be pushed out within minutes
