Lab V: Networking Between Container Hosts
===============================

## Description

In this lab you'll learn how to... Docker will do this

### Lab setup

Each participant has been handed a piece of paper with two machines `student00Xa` and `student00Xb` with their associated IP addresses. Each machine has been provisioned by Docker Machine with Docker 1.9 and REX-Ray 0.2 installed for use. The SSH password for each host is the host name. ie. Host `student001a`'s password is `student001a` 

**NOTE:** `v1.0.0-rc1` is going to be used for Swarm as of this writing to allow libnetwork to properly function.

#### Mac/Linux
Use Terminal
`ssh IPADDRESS -l student001a`

#### Windows
Use PuTTy
