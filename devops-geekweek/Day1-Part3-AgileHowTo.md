# Backlog

The Product Owner is responsible for creating a list of things he/she wants done, called a backlog.  They have exclusive rights to prioritize this backlog of work.

---

# Sprint Planning Meeting

* Timeboxed to 4 hrs
* This meeting is a _conversation_ between the Product Owner and the team
* The team has the power to push back and voice concerns or impediments
* Definition of 'done'

---

## At this point, the Product Owner is typically asked to leave while the team decomposes the sprint backlog items into tasks

---

## While the Product Owner is asked to leave so that the team can candidly discuss the work, he or she is still expected to be “on call” to answer questions

# Story Pointing
###The general characteristics of story points include:

* Story points represent the total amount of work required to fully implement a user story
* The stories are estimated independently by team members and the team drives toward a consensus opinion

---

# Story Pointing (cont)

* If a user story is too large to be implemented in one iteration it needs to be broken down into two or more smaller stories
* Many of the estimating models are designed as games that are interesting and engaging for the project team
