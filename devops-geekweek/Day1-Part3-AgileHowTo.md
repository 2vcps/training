# Backlog

The Product Owner is responsible for creating a list of things he/she wants done, called a backlog.  They have exclusive rights to prioritize this backlog of work.

# Sprint Planning Meeting

* timeboxed to 4 hrs
* this meeting is a _conversation_ between the Product Owner and the team.
* the team has the power to push back and voice concerns or impediments.
* definition of 'done'

---

> At this point, the Product Owner is typically asked to leave while the team decomposes the sprint backlog items into tasks. While the Product Owner is asked to leave so that the team can candidly discuss the work, he or she is still expected to be “on call” to answer questions, clarify acceptance criteria, or renegotiate

#Story Pointing

---

The general characteristics of story points include:

* Story points represent the total amount of work required to fully implement a user story.
* The stories are estimated independently by team members and the team drives toward a consensus opinion.

---

* If a user story is too large to be implemented in one iteration it needs to be broken down into two or more smaller stories.
* Many of the estimating models are designed as games that are interesting and engaging for the project team.
