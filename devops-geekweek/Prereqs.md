# Description

List of necessary tools to have installed and required reading material due before the first day of the class.

## Hardware/Software
 - One of the following combos:
   - MacOS (10.9+)
   - Windows 7+ *and* a Linux VM (either with as a local VM, or on Amazon or Digital Ocean or something).  Note: you could use Vagrant to do this easily :).
   - A webcam that works with Google Hangouts.  If you have a Mac with builtin webcam, thats fine.  If not, buy one and expense it.

## Command Line
 - [Linux/Unix Command Line](https://www.udemy.com/linux-command-line-volume1/).  You should understand how to move around on a Linux command line.

## Tools
