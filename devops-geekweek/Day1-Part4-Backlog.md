As an end user, I want an app that:

* grabs images from twitter
* filters by hash tag

---

As an ops manager, I want that app to:


* catalog the images in a database so that they can be queried quickly
* log to a web service so that I can evaluate problems easily.

---

As a Application Owner, I want the app to

* store the images in an object store so that I reduce cost per GB
* be scalable at will, up or down so that I can save money

---

As a partner manager with EMC, I want it to


* use EMC ViPR as the object store because it helps our relationship
* Use Federation tools where possible
