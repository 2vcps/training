As an end user, I want an app that:

* grabs images from twitter
* filters by hash tag

As an ops manager, I want that app to:

* store the images in an object store
* catalog the images in a database
* be scalable at will, up or down

As a partner manager with EMC, I want it to

* use EMC ViPR as the object store
